## 💪🏽️ What this project is about?? <a name = "aboutit"></a>
It's a repo where I save my "lab python scripts". I decided leave it public, to help others students like me in this long study journey.

## 🛠️ How does it works?? <a name = "Howdoesitworks"></a>
It's just simple scripts that you can run on your pc, MAC even Windows.

You will need:
* Python3
* A code editor as you like (I like VSCode ❣️)
* Terminal

To run those scripts use:

* Open a terminal.
* Type:
```
python3 /your_path/your_script.py
```
